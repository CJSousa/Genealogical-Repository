Comment:

We have completed  13/13 functions and present each and every single on of them in this program.
For most methods in this project, we assumed that the repository can never be empty, 
having treated such case when meantioned in the project guide.
In certain auxiliary functions, however, unexpected cases (empty lists or reps) 
were also treated or presented in preconditions either for the sake of recursion, 
either to present a more logical reasoning.

(* FUNCTION supremum *)

(* Given the complexity of this function, we shall first attempt
	to present the reasoning used to solve it.
	
	Firstly, we calculate all the common ancestors of a list of individuals.
	If such list has only 1 element, that element 
	is to be returned, regardless of distance.
	
	Then, we start looking for the closest ancestor, starting from the roots that 
	are also common ancestors.

	From then on, our goal was to find a way to recursively search for the next
	ancestor(s) that is/are children of these "new level" ancestors.

	However, we could not successfully search through all levels 
	(sepremum does not work, for instance, for example9).

	As a result, we have decided to present the code that we believe works for some 
	cases/levels, and still present our attempt to solve the function at its best, 
	in commented code, at the end of "spremum".

	Last note: our code works any case where the closest ancestor 
	is directly below the roots that are also common ancestors.
